# Data Engineering eportfolio artifact

## Author: Mario Frederick
## Degree Program: B.S. in Computer Science - Southern New Hampshire University
## Course: CS-499: Capstone

## About This Repository 

This repository serves as the central hub for my CS-499 Computer Science Capstone ePortfolio. It showcases enhanced versions of key projects developed throughout my degree program, demonstrating growth in three major areas of computer science:
	1.	Software Design and Engineering
	2.	Algorithms and Data Structures
	3.	Databases
Each enhancement reflects both my technical development and my readiness for a professional data engineering role.

## Featured Artifact
### Project: Grazioso Salvare Animal Data Dashboard (CS-340)

- Original Purpose:** Developed a full-stack dashboard application using Python, MongoDB, and Dash to help *Grazioso Salvare* identify rescue-ready dogs through data visualization and filtering.  
- Enhancement Goal:** Refactor into an object-oriented ETL pipeline with secure credential handling, improved algorithms for data transformation, and advanced MongoDB aggregation for analytical insights.

## Enhancement Overview

| **Category** | **Focus** | **Enhancement Summary** |
|---------------|-----------|--------------------------|
| **Software Engineering & Design** | Object-Oriented Refactoring | Converted the CRUD and ETL logic into modular classes (`ETLManager`, `AnimalDatabaseHandler`, `DashboardController`) for scalability, maintainability, and security via environment variables. |
| **Algorithms & Data Structures** | ETL & Data Processing Efficiency | Implemented optimized merge and transformation algorithms using hash maps and Pandas vectorization to handle 50k+ records efficiently. |
| **Databases** | MongoDB Optimization & Analytics | Designed aggregation pipelines to calculate average shelter time and adoption trends by breed, integrated MongoDB Atlas for secure cloud deployment, and created compound indexes for faster lookups. |

## Techincal Skills Demonstrated
- Python (Object-Oriented Programming, Data Analysis, Dash Framework)
- MongoDB (CRUD Operations, Aggregation Pipelines, Atlas Cloud Hosting)
- ETL Design (Extract, Transform, Load workflows with Pandas and PyMongo)
- Secure Software Practices (Environment Variables, Logging, Authentication)
- Algorithm Optimization & Data Structure Utilization
- UML & Data Flow Diagram Documentation

## Career Alignment 
This ePortfolio demonstrates the skills required for entry-level data engineering roles, focusing on designing scalable data pipelines, optimizing data transformations, and ensuring data security in cloud environments.
It reflects my readiness to advance into real-world data systems engineering while pursuing my M.S. in Data Engineering and future leadership roles in technology.
